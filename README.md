## 📌 Project Tasks

### 🗂️ Task 1: To-Do List (CLI App)

A simple command-line to-do list that lets users:
- Add tasks
- View current tasks
- Delete completed tasks  
It stores tasks in a text file so data persists between sessions.

### 🧮 Task 2: Arithmetic Calculator

A terminal-based calculator that can perform:
- Addition, Subtraction
- Multiplication, Division  
User inputs are handled with basic error checking and arithmetic logic.

### 🔐 Task 3: Password Generator

This script generates strong, secure passwords using:
- Random uppercase, lowercase letters
- Numbers and special symbols  
User specifies the password length. Built using Python’s `random` and `string` libraries.
